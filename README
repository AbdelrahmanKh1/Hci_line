Columns-> description:
----------------------
trialIdx -> the overall current trial number

NumberInBlock -> the number of the trial in the block

direction -> orientation of lines (0 = L->R, 1 = R->L, 2 = Up->Down, 3 = Down->Up)

speed -> speed user should do (0=Slow,1=Medium,2=Fast)

timeMilSec -> time in milisecond

mouseX -> raw mouse x

mouseY -> raw mouse Y (windows origin is top left while openGL origin is bottom left)

InvertedMouseY -> real mouse Y to use which is consistent with openGL lines

greenX0 -> Begin Line start x (without thickness)

greenX1 -> Begin Line end x (without thickness)

greenY0 -> Begin Line start y (without thickness)

greenY1 -> Begin Line end y (without thickness)

redX0 -> End Line start x (without thickness)

redX1 -> End Line end x (without thickness)

redY0 -> End Line start y (without thickness)

redY1 -> End Line end y (without thickness)
